## Housekeeping

> - Additional final project examples
>	- Please don't share beyond class members
>  - Continue to submit coding challenges
> - Reach out for help if needed!!

> - Meh :)
> - My workflow uses Python to collect data and create measures, then R to do statistics and create visualizations
> - Can also export to SPSS, Stata, or whatever. Everything reads CSV files!
