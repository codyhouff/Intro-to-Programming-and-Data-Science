## Principles for code organization

> - 3 directories
>	- code
>	- data
>	- paper


## Reproducible workflows and best practices

> - The idea is to be able to fix any step in the workflow and have the rest run with minimal problems
>	- Data updates
>	- Bugs
>	- Changes to measures or questions
> - Save raw data
> - Run code in order
> - Write comments! (or text in Jupyter)
