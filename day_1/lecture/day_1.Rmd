## Introductions

## Dad Joke

- Why did the nearsighted man fall in the well?

> - He couldn't see that well!

# The Class


## Programming provides exciting opportunities for social scientists

> - Digital data is exploding and programming is required to do research at scale
> - Algorithms mediate more and more interactions and understanding programming can help us to analyze them
> - Computational methods let us do new things
>	- NLP
>	- Simulation
>	- Large-scale experiments
> - There is value in "thinking like a computer"

## Goals

> - Learn basic programming
> - Be able to collect and visualize data from the web
> - Present computational research
> - Read and evaluate computational social science research

## This is an intense "bootcamp" intended to teach the basics of skills used by computational social scientists

> - It's going to be intense! :)
> - But we can do it!
> - Week 1: Python for Everybody
> - Week 2: Pandas, visualizations, and APIs
> - Week 3: Data cleaning, version control, etc.
> - Week 4: Work on final project

## Day-to-day

> - Example paper
>	- One person will present each day + lead discussion
>	- Others will skim
> - Lecture
>	- Recorded lecture on coding topic
>	- Notebook to follow along - download and run each day
>	- Class time focused on counfusions + Coding Challenges
> - Coding Challenges
>	- Random "cold calling" for reviewing solutions
>	- 5-10 minutes in small groups to prepare
> - Let me know what isn't working


## Synchronous classes

> - 1 PM - discussion of example paper
> - ~1:30 - review of concepts/homework questions
> - ~2:30 - Co-working / office hours
> - OH by appointment

## Coding Challenges

> - Exercises from the book
> - Jupyter Notebooks
> - Suggested approach:
>	- Try on your own
>	- Work with a partner
>	- Ask questions on Discord
>	  - Surround code with three backticks (```)
>	- Look up solutions (where available)


## Final Project

> - Default option
>	- Jupyter notebook
>	- Methods + result section of paper
> - Replication?
> - Do what is best for your future goals

## Project Milestones

> - Final project
>	- Really quickly identify a dataset and general plan (Week 1)
>	- Project planning doc (Week 2)
>	- Project presentation + report (Week 4)

## Grades

> - Goal is learning
> - Two self-assessment reflections

# Resources

## Wiki

> - Schedule
> - Links to readings
> - Slides and videos may be from older versions of the class
>	- I will try to stay 2 days ahead

## Brightspace

> - Readings
> - Example Projects

## Discord

> - Post questions and help each other
> - Synchronous meetings
> - Office Hours

## Anaconda / Jupyter Intro
