## Dad Joke

- Why did the nearsighted man fall in the well?

> - He couldn't see that well!

# The Class

## Goals

> - Learn basic programming
> - Be able to collect and visualize data from the web
> - Present computational research
> - Read and evaluate computational social science research

## Programming provides exciting opportunities for social scientists

> - Digital data is exploding and programming is required to do research at scale
> - Algorithms mediate more and more interactions and understanding programming can help us to analyze them
> - Computational methods let us do new things
>	- NLP
>	- Simulation
>	- Large-scale experiments


## About the class

> - It's going to be intense! :)
> - But we can do it!
> - 10 AM - Recorded lecture
> - 11 AM - Co-working / office hours
> - OH by appointment

## Day-to-day

> - Coding Challenges
> - Readings

## Final Project

> - I'm compiling some example projects
> - Whatever is most valuable for you
>	- Jupyter notebook
>	- Methods + result section of paper
>	- Replication

## Project Milestones

> - Final project
>	- Really quickly identify a dataset and general plan
>	- Project planning doc
>	- Project presentation + report
