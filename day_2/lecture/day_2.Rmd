# Day 2

## Dad Joke

> - Where do you take someone who has been injured in a hide-and-seek accident?
> - To the I.C.U.

## Housekeeping

> - Solutions for Day 2 aren't due until morning of Day 3 (i.e., tomorrow)

# Programming Principles

## Introduction

> - Python holds things in RAM, and writes to secondary memory / disk
> - Running Python
>	- Terminal
>	  - Interactive
>	- Command line
>	- Jupyter
> - Python is interpreted, not compiled

## Debugging

> - Common bugs
>	- Syntax
>	- Intermediate objects
>	- Complexity
> - Strategies
>	- Read through the code
>	- Make things visible
>	- Simplify

## Variables

> - Name that stores data
> - Has different types, e.g.:
>	- Strings
>	- Integers
>	- Floats
>	- Lists
>	- Dictionaries
> - Can't start with a number
> - Usually written_like_this
> - If it's not saved to a variable (or to disk), it's gone!

## Conditionals

> - Control flow
>	- Run different parts of the code depending on the "state"
> - Conditionals depend on booleans
>	- Expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False`
>	- `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `in`, or `not in`
>	- They are evaluated in order and can "short circuit"

## Example of a conditional

```{python, echo=TRUE}
#x = input("How many hours have you been working on this homework?")
x = 6
if x > 5 or xy == 45:
  print("That's too long!")

```

## Functions

> - Pieces of code that you want to reuse
>	- Often take in "arguments"
>	- They do something with the arguments, and often "return" something

## Types of functions

> - Built in functions
>	- print()
>	- type()
> - Modules / libraries
>	- import random
>	- random.randint(1,5)


## Example function

```{python, echo=TRUE}

def exclaim(s):
  # Changes a normal string into an exclamation!
  s = s.upper()
  return s + '!!'
  
exclaim("Hello, everyone")

```


# HW Review

## Day 1

> - How did it go?
> - What do you still have questions about?
