I’ve been studying viruses in the laboratory since 1975 when I obtained my PhD with Peter Palese, studying influenza viruses. I then went on to do postdoctoral research with Nobel laureate David Baltimore at MIT. There I produced the first infectious DNA copy of an animal virus, poliovirus. In 1982 I started my laboratory at Columbia which has been active to this day. Some of our accomplishments include identification of the cell receptor for poliovirus, and establishment of the first transgenic mouse model for a viral disease, poliomyelitis.

I not only do research on viruses but have written a virology textbook, I teach virology to undergraduates at Columbia, do a weekly podcast about viruses (microbe.tv/twiv), and much more (YouTube.com/profvrr). All of this makes me uniquely qualified to talk about a viral pandemic.

In this AMA I’ll be pleased to answer questions on SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, including origins of the virus, virus variants and their properties, the disease, vaccination, antivirals, and what the future holds for us.

I will be here between 12pm-2pm eastern time US to answer your questions.",2021-09-15 11:33:19,Coronavirus

Megathread: Recall Election against California Governor Newsom Fails,"NBC News and CNN have projected that the gubernatorial recall against incumbent Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has failed. With over 60% of the expected vote in and nearly 8 million votes counted, the No vote (which would retain the Governor) maintains a 67-33 edge and a raw vote lead of nearly 2.8 million. While the remaining vote is expected to be more Republican and, thus, the margin will shrink throughout the night and in the coming days, the remaining vote is unlikely to impact the outcome of the recall.

Had the recall succeeded, Question 2, on who Governor Newsom’s successor would have been, currently shows Republican radio talk show host Larry Elder with 43% of the vote, leading his nearest rival, Democratic YouTube personality Kevin Paffrath, who trails with 11% of the vote.",2021-09-15 03:52:19,politics

Discussion Thread: California Recall Election,"Today, California votes on whether to retain incumbent Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, or to replace him in a recall election. Gubernatorial recalls are relatively rare, with only two Governors ever having been successfully recalled and the most recent one failing in Wisconsin in 2012 against then-Governor Scott Walker. Nevertheless, the last successful recall occurred in 2003 in California against then-incumbent Democratic Governor Gray Davis. The California ballot first asks whether to recall (a **YES** vote) the Governor, or whether to retain him (a **NO** vote). It then asks in a second question who should be the replacement. Should the yes vote on Question 1 succeed, the highest polling replacement candidate would become Governor.

The recall election stemmed from a number of grievances against Governor Newsom, most prominently his handling of the COVID pandemic where he was seen dining unmasked at a high-end restaurant despite implementing restrictive measures limiting dine-in options last winter. Polling has shifted back and forth, with YES (supporting the recall) at one point leading in some surveys or falling within the margin of error, but more recent numbers give the NO side a somewhat larger lead. Should the recall succeed, polls have consistently shown that Republican talk show host Larry Elder would likely win the plurality of the vote and replace Newsom.

Polls will be open from 7AM to 8PM Pacific, and any eligible California voters can find their in-person polling precinct **[HERE](&lt;http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/polling-place)**&gt;. California permits in-person same day voter registration at polling precincts if you are eligible but have not yet registered. If you have received a mail-in ballot, you can drop off your ballot at a **[ballot drop-off location](&lt;https://caearlyvoting.sos.ca.gov/)**&gt; or mail your ballot in (no postage necessary). Ballots mailed by 8PM on Election Day will be counted if they arrive at the county election office by September 21.

Megathread, Week 37","Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. This is a weekly thread posted every Monday, in order to facilitate more discussion on local issues on /r/politics. Since this is intended to be a thread about local politics, top-level comments that are exclusively about national issues will not be allowed. When commenting, please include the state you're living in, and don't forget to link sources. **Also, please actually describe what happened. Things like ""I live in X, you know what happened"", ""Nothing happened"" or ""[Politician] continues to be an idiot"" isn't helpful to users and will be removed.**

If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Enjoy discussion, and review [our civility guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_please_be_civil) before engaging with others.
